#QAZ WKL

This repository contains the STL files for the QAZ WKL case that is adapted from the original [QAZ keyboard](https://www.cbkbd.com/product/qaz). It's design is similar to the [QEZ keyboard](https://github.com/kb-elmo/QEZ), but differs in that it keeps the usb cutout on the left side of the board. Note that the dimensions are for a slightly customized pcb derivative so users are warned to check the dimensions if using the stock pcb.
